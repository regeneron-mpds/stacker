    Stitch patches of an structure into a full structure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    patches : np.ndarray
        Patches of the structure to be reconstructed. Must be of shape [M, N, O, P, C]
        (an M x N grid of C-channel O x P patches, where M and O are row dimensions
        and N and P are column dimensions) OR of shape [T, O, P, C] (a collection
        of T C-channel O x P patches) when either patch_shape is not None or
        multichannel is False.
    tiled_shape : length-2 array, optional
        A length-2 tuple denoting the M x N grid of tiles (see documentation for
        `patches`). Default is None.
    overlap : int, optional
        The overlap between adjacent tiles. Default is 0.
    window_type : str, optional
        The type of window to use when overlapping tiles. Default is 'triang'.
        Although this may be set to any type of scipy window, it is recommended
        that this remain the default.
    suppress_corners : bool, optional
        Whether to employ an algorithm that eliminates corner artifacts between
        stitched patches. Default is True. While you may change this to False, it
        is not recommended as it will most likely introduce errors in the output.
    multichannel : bool, optional
        Whether the last dimension of the structure denotes channels. Default is False.
    order : str, optional
        A single character in the set {'r', 'c'}. 'r' denotes row-major arrangement
        of tiles whereas 'c' denotes column-major arrangement of tiles. Default is 'r'.
    verbose : bool, optional
        Whether to report progress. Default is False.

    Stitch patches of an structure into a full structure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    patches : np.ndarray
        Patches of the structure to be reconstructed. Must be of shape [M, N, O, P, C]
        (an M x N grid of C-channel O x P patches, where M and O are row dimensions
        and N and P are column dimensions) OR of shape [T, O, P, C] (a collection
        of T C-channel O x P patches) when either patch_shape is not None or
        multichannel is False.
    tiled_shape : length-2 array, optional
        A length-2 tuple denoting the M x N grid of tiles (see documentation for
        `patches`). Default is None.
    overlap : int, optional
        The overlap between adjacent tiles. Default is 0.
    window_type : str, optional
        The type of window to use when overlapping tiles. Default is 'triang'.
        Although this may be set to any type of scipy window, it is recommended
        that this remain the default.
    suppress_corners : bool, optional
        Whether to employ an algorithm that eliminates corner artifacts between
        stitched patches. Default is True. While you may change this to False, it
        is not recommended as it will most likely introduce errors in the output.
    multichannel : bool, optional
        Whether the last dimension of the structure denotes channels. Default is False.
    order : str, optional
        A single character in the set {'r', 'c'}. 'r' denotes row-major arrangement
        of tiles whereas 'c' denotes column-major arrangement of tiles. Default is 'r'.
    verbose : bool, optional
        Whether to report progress. Default is False.

    np.ndarray
